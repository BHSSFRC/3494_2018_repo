FRC Team 3494's 2018 source code repository.

## Getting started
1. [Set up your tools and account.](https://bhssfrc.github.io/new_prog_doc/)
2. Run the proper gradle task for your IDE.
 * `gradlew eclipse` for Eclipse
 * `gradlew idea` for IntelliJ
 * VS Code has no gradle task - use the idea one instead, I suppose.

## Building, running, and deploying new code

Build: `gradlew build`

Deploy: `gradlew deploy`

You can also add `--offline` to either of those if you have no internet access (and have run any gradle commnd in the past with internet access.)
